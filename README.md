# üóù Gatsby Starter Skeleton
A starter kit for a fresh [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) based site with a minimum amount of configuration but some opinionated choices. This starter does not (yet) include any datasource nor does it try to make too much assumptions on how your data is structured.

## Features
This starter incudes some default [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/) and custom components to deliver an SEO friendly [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

Default plugins: 
* gatsby-plugin-manifest
* gatsby-plugin-offline
* gatsby-plugin-react-helmet
* gatsby-plugin-sitemap

Other additions
* Normalize.css
* SEO header
* Site config file for global configuration
